## What will never work
| What  | Why |
| :-: | :-: |
| dGPU | Apple dropped support for Nvidia webdrivers since High Sierra. Besides there were never MacOS drivers for the gtx 16-series.|
| HDMI | The built-in HDMI port on this laptop is linked to dGPU. Unfortunately, there are no drivers and the dGPU is disabled.|
|Airdrop| Airdrop and Handoff are not supported on Intel wifi chips. For this, a Broadcom wifi chip needs to be acquired.|
